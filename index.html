    <p>The good news is that there's no wrong way to think about art. The even better news is that <a href="page1.html">we</a> designed this playful 5-step guide to let you get even more out of your visits! The challenges are intended to be faced at an actual art-exhibition (any!) and will be most fun to conduct with a partner. Enjoy!</p>

        <p><strong>Try this for a change-challenge:</strong> pick an artwork in the space you’re currently at (perhaps because you are naturally drawn to it, or perhaps because it is the most horrendous work in the room). Set your phone timer on two minutes and examine the work in the most detail as possible. What do you see? Are you discovering new things? Do you like the work more or less after spending some time with it?

        <p><i>When encountering a work of art, our eyes often involuntarily peak at the label to check its name. But did you know titling works of art only became standard practice about 300 years ago? (Yaezell, 2015) Titles can be great tools to help 'decipher' a work of art, but you could debate if it's actually part of the work itself. Especially when - as often happened in the past - it's not even the artist who named the piece, but the curator or art-dealer.</i></p>
        <p><strong>If anyone can name a work of art, why don't I give it a try?-challenge:</strong> Before you check the title of a work, take a good look at the subject matter and make up a title of your own. Once you're happy with the masterpiece's fresh name, discuss with your partner. Thén, find out the original title. Be honest, which title is better? Were you close?</p> <p>You might find that your perception of the artwork changed now that you’ve learned about the title. Do you think the title of a piece is part of the work, or is it a separate thing? What could be reasons for artists to not name their works? </p>

        <p><i>Have you ever considered the importance of context when you encounter a work of art? The way an artwork is framed (literally and figuratively!) is crucial for the way you experience it. Consider how wildly different the same work would look in your grandparents' living room, a public square or a fancy restaurant. Even the sterile white walls of the gallery might not be such as 'neutral' as they perhaps intend to be...</i></p> 

        <p><strong>What's that Watson?-challenge:</strong> Instead of looking at the artworks, investigate in detail how the objects are installed. Are works clustered together, or vastly separated? Do some of them 'talk' to each other? In what ways are some works given more importance than others? Imagine encountering some of these works on a flea market. What effect does the installation and the gallery-space have on your experience of the work of art?</p>

        <p><i>In 1989 the Guerrilla Girls made the world-famous poster entitled “Do Women Have To Get Naked to Get into the Met. Museum?” They commented on the fact that less than 5% of the artists represented in the museum were women, while 85% of the nudes were female. In 2012 these figures respectively counted to 4% and 76%.

        <p><strong>Channel your inner-art-activist-challenge:</strong> take a look at the artist(s) presented, and count how many of them might identify as male, female or perhaps identify somewhere else across the spectrum of gender identity. Are they evenly divided? Can you tell if the artists represented come from different cultural backgrounds? Do you think museums carry a responsibility to represent artists that reflect the diverse cultural, socio-political and biological mosaic that makes up society? What could be a consequence if they don’t? </p>

        <p><i>This shouldn't come as a major surprise, but creating exhibitions doesn’t come without a price-tag. Museums have to cover the expenses of personnel, art-transport, concept-design and installation. And even if exhibitions draw in lots of visitors, it is usually museums and galleries' restaurants and cafes (and not the ticket-sales) that give them their vital financial impetus. For this reason, museums are ususally also largely dependent on additional external financial support. These can be governmental institutions, private funders or corporate organisations for example.</i></p>
        <p><strong>Follow-the-money-challenge:</strong> It is important to to consider the sources of funding that made an exhibition possible, because art-exhibitions always establish and create some sort of narrative about the world. To find the organizations and institutions that made an exhibition possible, look at intro-didactics of the exhibition. On the bottom you can usually see logos from various organizations. Are they related to the topic of the exhibition in any way? Why might they have had an interest in supporting this specific show?</p>
